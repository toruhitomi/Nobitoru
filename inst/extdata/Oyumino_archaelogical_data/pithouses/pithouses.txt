Spatial point data (shapefile) depicting the location of the 364 pithouses attributed to the interval between Middle and Late Jomon period at Oyumino (Chiba, Japan). 

Spatial Projection: Tokyo / Japan Plane Rectangular CS IX (EPSG: 30169)

Attribute Table Fields:

"Code" -- Unique identifier of the pithouses. 

Notes:
Notice that the "Code" is generated from the site code (e.g. AYK) and
a sequential number (e.g. 001). Notice also the sequence might be
characterised by some missing numbers (e.g. AYK-001, AYK002, AYK-004,
...); this is due to the inheritance of the identifier from an older
dataset which included pithouses of all periods.
