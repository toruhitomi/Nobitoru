The accompanying dataset has been generated by converting the pottery
based chronology of Middle and Late  Jomon pithouses located at
Oyumino district (Chiba, Japan) into aoristic weights using the method
described in Crema (In press). The temporal resolution has been set to
100 years, with a chronological interval starting at 5500 cal BP and
ending at 3200 cal BP. Notice that the time-span of existence of
several pithouses goes beyond such interval and hence the sum of their
aoristic weights is < 1.

Additional info on how the data has been generated can be found in
<workflow.R> and <time2aoristic.R>

Attribute Table Fields:
"Pithouse_ID"  -- Field where an unique identifier for each pithouse (in string format) is being stored.
"-5500", "-5400" ... "-3300" -- Fields containing the aoristic weights. The field name refers to the start date of each 100-year temporal block.
