The accompanying dataset provides basic information to the 364 pithouses attributed to the interval between Middle and Late Jomon period at Oyumino (Chiba, Japan).

"Pithouse_ID" -- Field where a unique identifier for each pithouse (in string format) is being stored.
"Original_ID" -- Field containing the original unique identifier (in string format) used in the excavation report.
"SiteCode" -- Unique identifier referring to the site where the pithouse has been recovered (in string format).
"MajorAxis" -- Field containing the size of the major axis in meters (when available) as noted in the publication  (in real numeric format).
"MinorAxis" -- Field containing the size of the minor axis in meters (when available) as noted in the publication  (in real numeric format).
"PotPhase" -- Field containing pottery-based chronology as noted in the publication  (in string format).
"REF" -- Unique identifier referring to the excavation report from which the information has been collected (in string format).
"TOPO_AFTER1", "TOPO_AFTER2","TOPO_AFTER3","TOPO_AFTER4" -- Express the topological relation to other pithouses. The fields contain the "Pithouse_ID" of all pithouses that are cut by the present one (string format).

Notes:
-"Pithouse_ID" is generated from the "SiteCode" (e.g. AYK) and a
sequential number (e.g. 001). 
- "Pithouse_ID" might be characterised by some missing numbers (e.g. AYK-001, AYK002, AYK-004, ...) referring to residential units outside the chronological range of interest and excluded for this dataset.
-"Pithouse_ID" can be used as linker for joining this table to the shapefile <pithouses> (the field "Code" of <pithouses> must be used in such case).
